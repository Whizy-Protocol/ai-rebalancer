# Whizy Protocol - AI Rebalancer Backend

Backend service for Whizy Protocol that provides AI-powered risk assessment, knowledge base queries, and automated market vault yield optimization on the Hedera network.

## Overview

The Whizy Rebalancer is a FastAPI-based backend that:
- ü§ñ Assesses user risk profiles using OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- üìö Provides protocol knowledge and AI-powered recommendations using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- üíº Manages non-custodial user wallets (users control their own keys)
- üîÑ Executes automated market vault rebalancing to optimal yield protocols
- üìä Optimizes yields for all users betting in active markets
- ‚õìÔ∏è Integrates with smart contracts on Hedera network
- üß™ Comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. AI Agents (`src/agent.py`)

**RiskClassifierAgent**
- Analyzes user responses using OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (temperature: 0.1 for consistency)
- Classifies users into risk profiles: low/medium/high
- Updates risk profile in wallet data automatically
- Uses structured JSON output for reliable parsing
- Risk classification framework:
  - **Low**: Conservative, stablecoins only, 2-8% APY target, max 5% drawdown
  - **Medium**: Balanced, major crypto + stablecoins, 4-12% APY target, max 10-20% drawdown
  - **High**: Aggressive, any asset, 8-20%+ APY target, max 30%+ drawdown

**KnowledgeAgent**
- RAG-based system using FAISS vector store with OpenAI embeddings
- Fetches real-time protocol data from knowledge API
- Provides context-aware answers based on user's risk profile
- Uses RetrievalQA chain for accurate information retrieval
- Risk-specific prompts from `models/prompt.json`
- Returns strategy recommendations with expected APY ranges and risk factors

#### 2. Wallet Management (`src/wallet.py`)
- Reads on-chain data for user wallets
- Users manage their own wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
- All transactions are signed on the frontend
- Backend functions:
  - Query user configuration from delegation contract
  - Get user USDC balance

#### 3. Automated Market Vault Rebalancing (`src/rules.py`)
- **AgentWalletSync**: Synchronous wallet operations for scheduled tasks
- **Operator-based rebalancing**: Backend calls `rebalanceMarketVault(marketId)` on prediction market contract
- Periodic runner checks all active markets and rebalances their vaults to optimal yield protocols
- Benefits ALL users with bets in those markets automatically
- **Manual rebalancing**: Users can also trigger rebalancing via frontend for immediate optimization

#### 4. Smart Contract Integration
- **WhizyPredictionMarket**: Market creation and vault rebalancing
- **MarketVault**: Individual market vaults (ERC4626) that hold bet funds and generate yield
- **ProtocolSelector**: Automatic best-yield protocol selection
- **RebalancerDelegation**: Optional user delegation for separate deposits (not used for market funds)
- **USDC Token**: Stablecoin for bets and operations

### Market Vault Rebalancing Architecture

```
User Wallet (MetaMask/WalletConnect)
    ‚Üì placeBet() on market
WhizyPredictionMarket Contract
    ‚Üì creates/uses MarketVault (ERC4626)
MarketVault Contract
    ‚Üì auto-deposits to best protocol
ProtocolSelector Contract
    ‚Üì selects optimal protocol
Yield Protocols (Aave, Morpho, Compound)
    ‚Üì generates yield for ALL market participants
    ‚Üë (Backend OR User) rebalanceMarketVault(marketId)
Backend Operator Wallet / User Wallet
```

**Key Points:**
- Users place bets on markets, funds go to market vault
- Market vaults automatically earn yield on all deposited funds
- **Automated rebalancing**: Backend operator rebalances market vaults hourly
- **Manual rebalancing**: Any user can trigger rebalancing via frontend
- Operator can only rebalance vaults, not withdraw funds
- Yield benefits ALL users with positions in that market
- Winners claim: principal + winnings + their share of yield
- Losers claim: their share of yield (lose principal to winners)
- Fully transparent on-chain operations

}
```

### Frontend Integration

**All delegation transactions must be signed on the frontend using the user's wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)**

**Contract Addresses:**
- WhizyPredictionMarket: `0x0f881762d0fd0E226fe00f2CE5801980EB046902`
- USDC: `0x5f2faF6b0B0F79fbD1B70e0ff244Da92C614e44a`

**Market Betting (Frontend):**

```javascript
// 1. Place a bet on a market
await predictionMarket.placeBet(marketId, isYes, amount);
// isYes: true for YES, false for NO
// Funds automatically go to market vault and earn yield

// 2. Manually trigger market vault rebalancing
await predictionMarket.rebalanceMarketVault(marketId);
// Any user can call this to optimize vault yields immediately

// 3. Claim winnings after market resolves
await predictionMarket.claimWinnings(marketId);
// Winners get: principal + winnings + yield share
// Losers get: yield share only

// 4. Check market info (read-only)
const info = await predictionMarket.getMarketInfo(marketId);
// Returns: market data, total assets, current yield, yield withdrawn

// 5. Check potential payout (read-only)
const payout = await predictionMarket.getPotentialPayout(marketId, userAddress);
// Returns: yesPayoutIfWin, noPayoutIfWin, currentYield
```

**Backend provides:**
- Risk assessment via AI
- Protocol knowledge queries
- User balance queries
- Automated market vault rebalancing (runs hourly)

### Health Check

#### `GET /health`
Check API health status.

## Running the Service

### Development

```bash
# Start the API server
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Production

```bash
# Using gunicorn
gunicorn main:app -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Scheduled Market Vault Rebalancing

The automated rebalancer runs hourly via `scheduler.py`:

```bash
# Start scheduler (runs in background)
python scheduler.py
```

**How it works:**
1. Scheduler calls `runner()` from `src/rules.py` every hour
2. Queries database for all active markets (not resolved, end time in future)
3. For each active market, operator wallet calls `rebalanceMarketVault(marketId)` on prediction market contract
4. Market vault withdraws all funds from current yield protocol
5. Market vault deposits all funds to optimal yield protocol (via ProtocolSelector)
6. All users with bets in that market benefit from better yields

**Manual Rebalancing:**
Users can also trigger rebalancing from the frontend anytime:
```javascript
// Frontend calls this directly
await predictionMarket.rebalanceMarketVault(marketId);
```
This immediately optimizes the market vault without waiting for the hourly scheduler.

## Data Storage

### User Tracking

**Note:** The backend does NOT store user wallet data. Users control their own wallets.

For automated rebalancing, you need to track which users have enabled auto-rebalancing:

**Option 1: Database**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  wallet_address VARCHAR(42) PRIMARY KEY,
  auto_rebalance_enabled BOOLEAN,
  risk_profile INT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Option 2: Event Listening**
Listen to delegation contract events:
- `AutoRebalanceEnabled(address user, uint8 riskProfile)`
- `AutoRebalanceDisabled(address user)`
- Track users who enable/disable via events

**Current Implementation:**
- `runner()` function needs user tracking implementation
- Currently returns early as no tracking is implemented
- Frontend should notify backend when users enable auto-rebalancing

## Smart Contract Integration

### Smart Contracts Used

## User Flow

### 1. Onboarding
```
User connects wallet (MetaMask/WalletConnect)
    ‚Üí Frontend checks user has HBAR (for gas)
    ‚Üí Frontend checks user has USDC
```

### 2. Risk Assessment (Optional - for AI recommendations)
```
User answers questions
    ‚Üí POST /generate-risk-profile
    ‚Üí Returns risk level (low/medium/high)
    ‚Üí GET /get-strategy-recommendation
    ‚Üí Returns optimal strategy
```

### 3. Place Bet (Frontend Transaction)
```
User selects market and position (YES/NO)
    ‚Üí Frontend calls placeBet(marketId, isYes, amount)
    ‚Üí User signs transaction in wallet
    ‚Üí USDC transferred to prediction market contract
    ‚Üí Funds deposited to MarketVault
    ‚Üí MarketVault auto-deploys funds to best yield protocol
    ‚Üí User's position recorded with shares
```

### 4. Automated Yield Optimization
```
Scheduler runs hourly
    ‚Üí Queries all active markets from database
    ‚Üí For each market: operator calls rebalanceMarketVault(marketId)
    ‚Üí Market vault moves funds to optimal protocol
    ‚Üí All users in that market earn better yields

OR

User manually triggers rebalancing
    ‚Üí Frontend calls rebalanceMarketVault(marketId)
    ‚Üí Immediate optimization without waiting
```

### 5. Claim Winnings (Frontend Transaction)
```
Market resolves ‚Üí User clicks claim
    ‚Üí Backend GET /getPotentialPayout (check winnings + yield)
    ‚Üí Frontend calls claimWinnings(marketId)
    ‚Üí User signs transaction in wallet
    ‚Üí Winners receive: principal + winnings + yield share
    ‚Üí Losers receive: yield share only
```

## Security Considerations

### Non-Custodial Architecture
- ‚úÖ Users control their own wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Backend never has access to user private keys
- ‚úÖ Backend cannot withdraw user funds from delegation contract
- ‚úÖ Users can withdraw anytime via frontend
- ‚úÖ All operations are transparent on-chain
- ‚úÖ Backend only reads data and executes operator rebalancing

### Operator Permissions
- ‚úÖ Operator can only call `rebalance()` function
- ‚úÖ Cannot withdraw or transfer user funds
- ‚úÖ Can be removed by contract owner if compromised

### Private Key Management
- ‚úÖ Users manage their own private keys via wallet apps
- üîí Operator key stored in secure environment variable
- üîí Production: Store operator key in HSM, KMS, or secure vault

### Smart Contract Security
- ‚úÖ ReentrancyGuard on all functions
- ‚úÖ Access control for operator and owner functions
- ‚úÖ Users can disable auto-rebalancing anytime

## Monitoring & Logging

The service logs all operations:
- User wallet creation
- Deposit/withdrawal transactions
- Rebalancing operations
- Errors and exceptions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No users with auto-rebalance enabled (tracking not implemented yet)"**
- User tracking needs to be implemented via database or event listening
- See "Data Storage > User Tracking" section for implementation options

**"OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY not set in .env"**
- Add operator private key to `.env` file

**"InsufficientBalance" on withdrawal**
- Check user's actual deposited amount via `/action/get-user-config`
- Use the `deposited_amount` value for withdrawal

**Transaction fails with "AutoRebalanceNotEnabled"**
- User has disabled auto-rebalancing
- User needs to call `/action/enable-auto-rebalance` first

**Transaction fails with "NotOperator"**
- Operator wallet address not authorized
- Contract owner needs to call `addOperator(address)`
